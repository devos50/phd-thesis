While it is often said that a PhD is a solitary and though process, I very much enjoyed most aspects of it.
However, I would not have completed this journey were it not for the continuous support of colleagues, friends, and family!

First, I would like to thank Johan Pouwelse, my promotor and daily supervisor.
Under your supervision, there has not been a single day where I was bored with my research or ran out of ideas, even after yet another paper rejection.
Our random and unorganized discussions, whether or not with other lab members, have been a great source of inspiration.
Your leadership and advice has helped me tremendously to become an independent researcher and to get my ideas published in the scientific community, which was definitely not always easy.
I highly value your relentless focus on practicality and usability (\enquote{no passing grade without running code}).
I enjoyed the freedom that you give every individual member of the lab to explore new ideas, and I am grateful for the many opportunities you gave me to (co-)supervise BSc and MSc students.

I would also like to express my gratitude to my promotor Dick Epema, who was always willing to bring my research work to the next level by identifying both fundamental flaws and minor presentation issues.
Your knowledge, together with your detailed and critical feedback, has helped me to improve my writing skills, research papers and this thesis.

I thank all my collegues for making the office life very enjoyable.
Quinten, Egbert, and Sandip: I fondly remember the times we worked on Tribler and the conversations we had in our old office, most of the time around the coffee machine.
Bulat, thank you for the many discussions we had about our research, science, and other topics.
Can, Georgy and Mitchell, thank you for your help as co-author on various papers!
I also thank Georgy for providing many insights from a socio-technological perspective on the work we produce as lab.
Ayman, thank you for inviting me to work together on an energy trading platform, I've learned many new things about your field!
I would also like to thank Elric, Vadim, Alexander and Andrew for our collaboration on Tribler.
Tamara, Kim and Sophie: thank you for taking care of our administrative burdens!
I also would like to thank the graduate school for the opportunity to physically defend my thesis during the ongoing pandemic.

Besides the people directly involved in my research, I would like to extend my gratitude to a large group of people with whom I spent many Wednesday evening playing games, eating pizza and/or drinking in the /pub and the Doerak Caf√©.
These evenings were very helpful in unwinding from the (sometimes hectic) academic life.
Otto, as the regular member of this group, thank you for the many conversions and coffee/beer talks that we had!
I would also like to thank Stefan, Jesse, Hans, Ernst, Maria, Thomas, Gijs, Tim, Chris, Jetse, Alexander, Taraneh, and others who occasionally joined for the Wednesday evening activities (there are just too many to list here!).

I am grateful for the many memories I made with friends.
Laurens, thank you for the many projects we worked on, the games we played, the tv shows we watched (most of which seem to be cancelled for some reason), and in general for great memories since I started my BSc in Delft!
Laurens, Anton and Martijn: thank you for the amazing trips during summer and winter holidays that we made across the world, whether or not accompanied by others.
I will never forget that feeling after we (finally) reached the summit of Mount Fuji!\emojifuji{}

Last, but definitely not least, I would like to thank my parents for their continuous support.
I would also like to thank Walter for teaching me many new skills during the construction of our \enquote{emergency} apartment.
